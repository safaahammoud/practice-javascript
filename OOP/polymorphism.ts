//main benefit is to not have in the superclass ifs and nested ifs to when the subclasses change
// methods can have different forms
// has 2 types static/dynamic 
// dynamic happens in runtime :share same params buts has different implementation
// static happens in compile time:
//     overloading: having the same name of methods but different signature of the params/
//         or having different number of parameters
