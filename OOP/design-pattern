// main goal of design patterns is solve repeated problem and make a reusability standard to deal with it

//static var or method is used when u want a single copy of it to be shared against multiple instancces of the class

//Singelton(sharing a  single washmachine among all residents in hotel):
    -restricts the instantation of the class to just one instance of it(that is done by having private constructor),
        what is its instance: static variable that is only accessed by a static public method

//Singelton example: when we have multiple applications and we want to have the same 
    printing functionality to be shared across multiple applications 
    -used for logging,caching and thread pool

// Factory pattern: is when u have a superclass and sub-classes and based on inputs u return one of
     its subclasses instance
// Factory pattern example: you create computer class(can be astract,interface,or normal) and then u create sub classes 
    PC,Server those 2 extends computer and you do a computer factory class and in its constructor you write an
    if condition that if the string input is equal to the type of one of the class subclasses value ,you return
    the instance of the matching sub class 
    Or when you want to create different products based on the type so the input is type and if a type is invalid 
    you throw exception (invalid type) so you create product factory for that that checks the types
